# chatterd

Background daemon for Chatter.

# Ok, but what is Chatter anyway?
Modern chat is packed with features, as long as you can use them. 
Generally, the clients are written in HTML with a ton of javascript, and little thought given to accessibility, or several reasonss.
There are some native clients, but they're not generally accessible for blind users.
I wanted to fix that. I'm also not all that great a programmer at the moment.
So, this is happening. And you get to watch it either burn down, or be amazing. Yay.
This readme won't always be this bad. But for now, you get what you get. Or maybe you git what you... Oh never mind.


Daemon responsibilities:
- Matrix and XMPP connections
- Presence and state
- Audio routing and calls
- Shared logic for all UIs
